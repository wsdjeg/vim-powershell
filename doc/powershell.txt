FOLDING                                                         *ps1-folding*

The ps1 syntax file provides syntax folding (see |:syn-fold|) for script blocks
and digital signatures in scripts.

When 'foldmethod' is set to "syntax" then function script blocks will be
folded unless you use the following in your .vimrc or before opening a script: >

    :let g:ps1_nofold_blocks = 1
<
Digital signatures in scripts will also be folded unless you use: >

    :let g:ps1_nofold_sig = 1
<
Note: syntax folding might slow down syntax highlighting significantly,
especially for large files.
